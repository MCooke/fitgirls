Clean & Modern Blogging

== Description ==

Verdant is a modern WordPress blog theme that is built with standards in mind. Verdant is how WordPress themes should be made - with a clear separation of theme & functionality, this means that your site content will always be intact regardless whether our theme is being used or not. More importantly, you won't get tied down with our theme.
